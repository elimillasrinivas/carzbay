        },
        {
          "question": "Can you match the Paint Colour Exactly to My Car?",
          "answer": "Yes, Automovill uses the exact color code which is mentioned in the RC copy of the car (when painting is done in the car). However, we do see a slight mismatch in case the color on the non-painted panels is faded already. In order to match, Automovill provides complementary polishing of the car after every painting."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much time does Denting & Painting take (for Panel/ Full-body Paint) ?",
          "answer": "For the painting process to be fool-proof it takes a minimum of 14 hours (as it includes - surfacing, putty work, coat 1-2-3, polishing, washing). We need to keep a minimum of 3 hours for drying with natural light for the color to exactly match. For full-body painting, it takes 7-10 working days because we remove the seats, mats, and other accessories from the car before painting as a hygiene-measure."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you provide this service under Insurance?",

        {
          "question": "Does Alloy-Wheel painting get covered in these Packages?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Should I go with Solid Painting or Metallic Painting?",
          "answer": "We shall proceed as per the color code mentioned in the RC of the car. Alternatively, we can discuss the mode of painting first and can decide on the color & type of paint. Please call us at +917353600400 to discuss with us."
